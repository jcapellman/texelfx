# texelfx

A larger project to provide an easy way to scale standard definition images or video to HD (and possibly 4k).

Rather than tackle that entire problem, I broke it into 3 versions.

First Version:
-Detection of Compression Artifacts (JPEG/MPEG)
-Removal of Compression Artifacts

Second Version:
-Detection of detail loss due to resolution
-Replacement of pixels due to resolution from a higher definition source

Third Version:
-Combine both versions above to scale content to the desired resolution
